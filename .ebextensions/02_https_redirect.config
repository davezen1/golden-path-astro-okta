# Optional: Configure HTTPS redirect via Application Load Balancer
# This requires setting up a load balancer with SSL certificate

# Note: For production, you should:
# 1. Configure a load balancer in EB environment settings
# 2. Add an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager
# 3. Configure listeners in the EB console
# 4. Update this file to enable HTTPS redirect rules if needed

# For now, this file is a placeholder for future HTTPS configuration
